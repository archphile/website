Living under this difficult situation (covid-19 pandemic) and under a very strict lock-down, lead to a lot of free time. So I took the opportunity and created new images for the Raspberry Pi 2/3 and the Odroid C2.

## Downloads

- [Download Archphile 1.19 beta - codename Corona](https://archphile.org/download)
- [Download the Archphile manual](https://archphile.org/manual/archphile-manual.pdf)

## Changelogs: 

- [Raspberry Pi changelog](https://archphile.org/changelog/rpi.txt)
- [Odroid C2 changelog](https://archphile.org/changelog/odroidc2.txt)

## Release updates
If there are any updates on packages/configuration that can be applied on these new images, all the relevant instructions will be given from the following links:

- [updates for the RPI](https://archphile.org/changelog/updates-rpi.txt)
- [updates for the Odroid C2](https://archphile.org/changelog/updates-odroidc2.txt)


## Support

While it's true that in general my time is very limited (and this was one of the reasons I officially stopped Archphile development), I decided to create a github repository so that everyone can submit an issue. This does not mean that I will answer. I will do my best but:

- please be patient
- make sure you 've read the [manual](https://archphile.org/manual/)
- if the manual is not enough or you found a bug, [submit your issue on github](https://github.com/archphile/support/issues).
 

As you may have noticed there is still no support for the **Raspberry Pi 4**. If you want me to help buy one (the 4gb version + case  + reliable heat shrink + at least 2 SD cards), please consider [donating](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=BDJDPBBTJDKZC&source=url)!

While I am not sure that I will continue development in general, if you help me buy a RPI 4, I will upload one functional image for sure.

Last but not least, you may have already realized that I am famous for my instability. I have announced twice that Archphile is dead and yet I am back with new images. 

Please do not take myself very seriously and I suggest that you don't take yours either!

I hope that everyone will remain OK and safe.

Greetings,

Mike
