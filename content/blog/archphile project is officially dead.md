Hi all,

I am writing to inform you that Archphile project is officially dead.

If you have a basic experience with Archlinux custom package creation, you can keep visiting [packages](https://github.com/archphile/packages) and [playground](https://github.com/archphile/playground) repositories on [my github page](https://github.com/archphile)
and use my **PKGBUILDs**, as I am actively maintaining them for personal use.

Greetings.

M.
