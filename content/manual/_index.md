Archphile, not having a gui for its configuration, is always a pain in the ass for users that don’t have any idea about Linux.

Since the beginning of this project, I tried to provide as much as information I could, mainly via the old website's Tips & Tricks section.

That was not enough and this is why since May 2018 I introduced the Archphile manual:

https://archphile.org/manual/archphile-manual.pdf

This document is still under development, but it includes most of the crucial information for setting up almost everything Archphile.

This document is just an .odt converted to PDF. You can find the editable file here:

https://github.com/archphile/manual

**Note:** Experienced Linux users will immediately notice the same systemd commands (plus some nano editing) to be repeated again and again. Please note that this document was created for people that don’t have any idea about Linux and may need to copy/paste commands in order to make their board functional.
